# Open Jurisdiction

The goal of this project is to build a suite of open-source jurisdictional blueprints allowing any group, community or network to stand up usable, fit-for-purpose governance frameworks. Currently, jurisdictional frameworks are limited to nation-states who impose their will and claim jurisdiction largely through force. It is hoped that this project may ultimately enable our species to do away with the concept of deriving jurisdiction through violence, and instead through mutual agreement at a much more localised level.

The 'base' documents will be foundational documents based on the Non-Aggression Principle (detailed below). All documents can be expanded from the base versions, and 'inherit' rules from 'master' documents. As the project grows, it is my hope that we'll have several 'ready made' jurisdictional frameworks for various situations and needs. 

Many of these will be designed not for personal interactions, but rather relationships at the commercial or organisational level. With many people doing business internationally, governing international commerce with 'digital' jurisdictions should become far more effective than with traditional 'land based' jurisdictions, provided that the framework is sufficiently robust. This may be achieved through a combination of written 'passive' rules and 'active' platform code, which will be explored in more detail as this project evolves.

## The Non-Aggression Principle

*"No one may threaten or commit violence ('aggress') against another man's person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor."*

- Murray N. Rothbard
